# Do-You-Need-A-New-Secure-Password?

## Description

This website is made to generate random password for users. This was built for users to avoid challenges of constantly making random sequence of password manually which can be very time consuming. I learned how to set variables and use for loops.

## Installation

There is no installation to use this website. The user will be able to access this website with a URL.

## Usage

The user will press generate password button.
It will prompt 4 yes/no questions that asks if they would like to include the following:
lowercase,
uppercase,
number,
special characters to their randomly generated password.
Once those questions are answered the program will generate random password for the user to use.
